title: Writing a Literature Review

A literature review is pretty crucial for a few reasons:

* It's expected that you produce one for your first year viva
* It's the only way to get up-to-speed on exactly what the state-of-the-art is in your field
* It teaches you as a researcher-in-training a fundamental skill: reading and assessing other people's work
* It gives you context for:
    * Thinking about viable hypotheses and experiments
    * Bringing insight into any discussion on your field

So while a literature review is quite an important part of your PhD, there's a lot to gain in doing it right, too.

## Writing the literature review

Some advice from [Tim Storer's advice document for new PHD students](https://github.com/twsswt/glasgow_socs_phd_bootstrap/blob/7809bee64b55ac714a8bee4d8e6de926776513ce/README.md):

 1. Create a chapter in your thesis called 'Literature Survey'.
 2. You forgot to do a commit of the new LaTeX file.  Go back and do that now.
 3. Decide on some initial search terms and try them out in Google Scholar, Elsevier, DBLP....  Write these down in your
   thesis (and commit). Be prepared to adjust your search terms as new related topics are discovered (and be disciplined
   about documenting your changes in your thesis).
 4. Conduct a search using your search terms and store the results in a management tool such as Mendeley.
 5. Decide on inclusion and exclusion criteria.  That's right, write them down and commit (you can always change them
   later).
 6. Read the papers you have found.
    1. Start by reading the abstract, introduction and conclusions.  Decide if the paper is sufficiently relevant to
       read the whole thing.  If it is relevant and meets your inclusion criteria, skim read the whole document once.
       Do *not* pause if there is a point where you don't understand.  This may seem odd, but often you will get a
       better understanding of a particular point if you have read the whole paper.  Now, if the paper is really
       critical to
      your work, then re-read it carefully.
    2. Create an annotated bibliography entry in your thesis for each paper that you read containing answers to the
       following sentences.
        * What did the authors seek to discover/learn/prove in their research?  What was their research question?
        * What was their methodology?
        * What were their conclusions?
    3. You may also find you can add discussion points on (this will happen the more you read):
        * Weaknesses in the paper - is there a undocumented limitation that you have found?
        * Relationships to other papers you have already read.
    4. Conduct backward and forward *snowballing* to find relevant papers that were cited and that cited the paper you
       are currently reading.  Add these papers into your reference manager and continue.
7. Don't be concerned if you start off only reading a few papers per day (perhaps only 1). Reading papers takes practice
   and as you become more familiar with your field, you'll start to identify the signposts in the paper that make
   reading easier.  As a rule of thumb you should expect to read between 100 and 200 papers for the initial draft of
   your literature review and you should allow 2-3 months for this.
8. As you start to build up a corpus of findings from step (6) start thinking about synthesis.  What are the common
   themes in the research area?  Where are the most recent authors talking about plans for future work?  Where is the
   field moving to?  Start trying to group your paragraphs about individual papers into related themes.  Gradually build
   an argument about the field, the limitations and the important research directions in the future.
9. If you find yourselve struggling to make progress on reading then it's okay to step away from the literature for a
   while.  One of my students talked about a literature review as like drinking water: you get the most benefit if you
   savour it in small sips, rather than trying to guzzle.
