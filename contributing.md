Hi! Thanks for checking out this unofficial PhD advice page. The idea here is that PhD students can write advice they wish they'd been given --- or *were* given --- when they started their own PhD, so that new students can learn from our experiences. It's great that you want to contribute!

This site is actually run from a [Github repository, linked here](https://github.com/Unofficial-Glasgow-PhD/unofficial-advice). Advice pages are kept in Markdown in the root of the repo, and are converted via Jekyll and Github Pages into a site which Github hosts for free! You can learn more about the setup by checking [the official Jekyll documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/), or just by perusing the code in the github repo.

If you want to contribute to the advice pages, *thank you*! This site only works because people share, and it's terrific to have a community-run colleciton of advice, for PhD students, by PhD students. There are two ways to add your contribution:

1. Fork the repo, make your edits, and then [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/). This is very much the preferred way of doing things!
2. If you're uncomforable with Git, [send an email with your advice to Tom Wallis at w.wallis.1 -at- research.gla.ac.uk](mailto:w.wallis.1@research.gla.ac.uk).

Where possible, please submit a pull request! This makes reviewing and agreeing on advice before it goes live much easier. If you email Tom, he'll just create a pull request on your behalf, so it's better to email asking how to *make* the pull request rather than just submitting advice. Ultimately, we'd rather people submitted advice than not, so if you really don't want to use Git, do email your words of wisdom rather than letting your experiences go to waste.

If you want to submit advice, the easiest way is to find the relevant page's markdown document in the repo. Click it to get the preview of the Markdown in Github, and write your edit. Press "propose file change" at the bottom --- you've now submitted your pull request with your own advice! Dancer. You're done. 

If you'd like to change multiple files or make more complicated changes, or just do things the traditional way, you should:

* Check to see whether someone's already mentioned what you want to!
* If your advice is new, create a fork of the repo where you can do your work. 
* Check the existing pages to see where it should fit. 
    * If you find a page where it's suitable, make the edit there and submit a pull request!
    * If not, we'll have to add a page.
      Do this by copying the preamble (the dashed lines at the top of a markdown file in the repo) and add your advice underneath, swapping out the title for something more suitable.<span class="sidenote">Email [Tom Wallis at w.wallis.1 -at- research.gla.ac.uk](mailto:w.wallis.1@research.gla.ac.uk) if you have problems adding a page, and he can help.</span>
* Now, submit your pull request.
