What should a new student expect in their typical first year? What's good practice? Maybe things like advice on the social side of things etc could go here.

<span class="marginnote">From [Tim Storer's advice to new PhD students](https://unofficial-glasgow-phd.github.io/unofficial-advice/)</span>

The first year of a PhD can seem very daunting, with lots of potential avenues to explore and the prospect of a
progression viva just four months away.  The purpose of the viva is to assess the likelihood of a student completing
their research within the remaining 2-2.5 years. The viva assesses four different aspects of a student's work:

1. Identify the broad area you want to work in and write an initial literature review.
   <br/>
   Purpose:

    * Start to become an expert in your chosen topic, and be able to demonstrate that you are an expert in the topic
   	  because you have studied the literature.
    * Identify more precisely the area within your broad research topic that you want to investigate during your PhD and
 	  make a convincing case that you've found a real question to answer (that hasn't been answered before).
    * Identify more precisely the area within your broad research topic that you want to investigate during your PhD and
      make a convincing case that you've found a real question to answer (that hasn't been answered before).
    * Be sure that any experiments you are conducting are novel (unless you are *explicitly* reproducing someone else's
      work).  You do not want to spend a lot of time completing an expensive experiment and a paper write up, only to
      discover that the work has already been done.
 
2. Undertake a mini-research Project.
   <br/>
   Purpose:

    * Begin to practice the methods you will employ during the rest of your PhD on a larger scale.
    * Demonstrate a capacity for conducting research.
    * Further investigate the research area you have identified to decide what further precise research questions should
      be answered.

3. Prepare a thesis statement and accompanying justification.
   <br/>  
   Purpose:
   
    * Demonstrate that you have identified a novel research contribution to be made and that you understand what is
      realistic to undertake within two years.
 
4. A plan for addressing the thesis statement over the following 2-2.5 years.
   <br/>

    * Demonstrate that you have a viable route to completion of your research project.
    * Demonstrate that you understand what is feasible and realistic in the time frame allotted.

From [Tim Storer's advice document](https://github.com/twsswt/glasgow_socs_phd_bootstrap/blob/master/README.md):

> I don't think I've ever been part of a first year review where *every* one of these goals has been successfully met.  In
> particular, most students have not adjusted their thinking regarding the 'depth vs breadth' argument above.
