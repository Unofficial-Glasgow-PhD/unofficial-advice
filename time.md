*Enjoy your life*. Treat your PhD like a job. Come in to work, work for ~7 hours, and then go enjoy yourself! Leave the building and don't think about work anymore.

Try not to work on weekends. Seriously. There's more to life than a PhD.

Take holidays! *You're allowed eight weeks off*. Use that time for friends and family. Explore the world. You'll never be this free again to do whatever you want to, whenever you want to.
