Advice on finding, reviewing, cataloging and citing papers. 

## Reading

It's important to get reading! You'll find that early reading informs your understanding of your field and gets you thinking about problems which might not have occurred to you without this extra context. Some people suggest trying to get into the habit of reading a paper every day.

You have to submit a literature review pretty early too, so getting an early start on reading means you'll have more time to put this together, and potentially a wider pool of papers to choose from.

## Reviewing

*Start reviewing papers as soon as possible*. Ask somebody in your office or your supervisor to give you guidance for the first few. The sooner you learn how to properly peer review a paper, the better for your career in academia --- because you'll do this a *lot*!

## Cataloging

Reference managers are absolutely essential for keeping track of what you've read, and categorising what you've come across so far. [Mendeley](http://mendeley.com/) is a classic choice of reference manager which is probably a good place to start.

You're going to read hundreds and hundreds of papers over the next few years, and you're going to need to know what they are and be able to refer back to them when writing up your research. Plus, if you don't keep track of what you've already seen, you'll probably end up re-reading lots of papers unintentionally! A good reference manager will keep track of highlights and notes on your pdfs too, and sync to your phone or tablet.

## Citing

Given you'll probably be writing in LaTeX, your citations will be kept in Bibtex. Consider keeping an [Annoted Bibliography](https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/annotated-bibliographies/), and remember that a citation manager such as Mendeley (see above) will export citations as Bibtex code when you need them (which is another benefit of using a citation manager).
