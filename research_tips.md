## Finding your feet in research ##

A piece of advice I've heard over and over again is that people get confused regarding the depth and breadth you have to go into when doing your PhD. I think that an ideal angle to take --- especially in your first year! --- is to try to narrow your topic down as much as possible.

Your PhD learning will undergo a pretty rapid expansion in scope as you begin reading papers and realising how large your field is. Regardless of what you're doing, someone's done something interesting in it, and it's *really* easy to get caught going down these rabbit holes!

Getting a feel for this breadth is crucial, though. It tells you what's interesting to you, what work has and hasn't been done already, the different angles one can take toward science in your field. For the first few months, you'll want to do a *ton* of reading...my advice is that, after that, find some project that should take a couple of months and try to complete that task (if your supervisor doesn't give you one themselves, which sometimes happens).

This is especially helpful for people whose research is self-directed. For students who are signing onto a project that's well defined from day 1, the clarity around what reseach you'd *like* to do doesn't matter much; if it's open ended, you can spend a lot of time hunting around for something ideal. 

Don't hunt around. 

Rather than wasting time, after that first explosion of activity, pick something concrete and *just do that*. The benefit is that you get a feeling for working on something that's:

1. Scoped in time
2. Is solid science
3. *Has deliverables*
4. *Doesn't have to be crucial work toward your thesis*

This means that you get a feeling for how to structure a large-scale research project (which, given that it's full time and completely under your control, can feel different to a masters thesis of similar size) in that meeting deliverables holds you accountable and can break up work into manageably sized chunks. Chunking like this is hard, though, and what's nice about your first 9-12 months is that the work you do in this time *doesn't have to be crucial to your thesis at all*. Later on, you won't have this flexibility, so make the most of it early on.

### Contributing ###

It can sometimes be hard to feel like you're *contributing* when you're finding your feet. For the first few months at least --- depending on how you structure your work --- you might not end up doing much practical work that goes anywhere, or feels like it is at least.

Contributing to other people's work can be a way around this. It's also a good way to get to know the people in your school, the work that's going on, and how experiments are typically run by PhD researchers (which might be useful to you soon!).

Most importantly, though, it's a good way to feel like you're doing something that matters, and contributing to research --- even if you're not contributing to your own at that precise moment.

Also! If you're in a field where you might one day need participants yourself, and you've participated in other people's studies when they've asked, they're a lot more likely to return the favour when you come knocking.

## Foster discipline ##

Treat your PhD like a job; your role should feel much closer to a 9-5 than it did to being an undergraduate / masters student. If you can, set up consistent times to come in and get things done. The strongest PhD candidates, in my opinion, come in and leave at consistent times and *leave their work at the office*.

In all likelihood, leaving your work at your office will be harder than it sounds. You'll have ideas bouncing around your head at 10pm that you might want to work on, papers you didn't get around to reading, and so on.

Burnout's an easy trap to fall into, though, and if you're not careful you'll quickly find your whole life being eaten up by the work you're doing. I've fallen into this trap myself. Still, it's easier for some than others. 

Speaking of burnout...

## Mental health and research ##

Research is tough on the mind. Taking on an important 4 year project is difficult: at times, you might feel like you might want to be an expert but can't deliver like others can; you might feel you can't manage your time; you might feel you've chosen the wrong field or profession; you might feel you've "lost your edge" or can't push through targets like you did before; you'll have your own experiences I can't predict too.

What I can say, though, is that *I haven't met anybody yet who's claimed this is easy for them*. Even the strongest PhD candidates I know have some long, dark teatimes of the soul when their research isn't going well.

The solution: talk to people about your work, when it's going well and when it's not. Make sure they do the same. The community you can build in a PhD is wicked good, so make use of the fact that we're all doing something wild and unique and lean on that when times get tough.

Glasgow University (and most others) have counselling and mental health support available should you need it; if you think you might, it's better safe than sorry, and it's far easier to quieten the mind spaniels before they get unmanageably big.

## Read often

Read as often as you can! Advice I was given in the beginning of my PhD was to read a paper every morning. It's harder than it sounds but it's a good goal to aim for, and if you can get into that habit it'll serve you well.

Especially in the early stages, reading is crucial, so you can gain a really solid working knowledge of your field. You can't do research without it!

## Keep a research journal

I've received the advice to keep a research journal a few times. I've kept one on and off myself; reflecting on the benefits I've experienced and heard others talk about, you should probably keep one for any or many of the following reasons:

1. It keeps you on track. When you begin a day, you can start right where you left off, because you've actually recorded what that is.
2. It reminds you that you've actually done solid work. If you've been banging your head against a wall for a week and feel like you've made no progress, *but you have a journal of the effort*, you still have something to show, which can be really settling.
3. Having something to show when you haven't met deliverables etc can be really useful when sitting in a supervisor meeting. Being able to look over your journal for the last week, remember what you've worked on --- what worked *and* what didn't --- sets you up nicely to discuss your direction with your supervisor.
4. It keeps you accountable. When you haven't done work, the journal's going to reflect that. Rigour and discipline are your friends, and accountability is crucial to build those.
