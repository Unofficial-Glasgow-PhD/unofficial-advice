Progressions have a weird reputation. People are terrified of them. However, the main purpose of having them is to give you valuable feedback on your work!

The panel consists of academic staff in your area who are not involved in your research. This is a perfect opportunity to step back and look at your research from a different angle. You and your supervisor might not see the forest for all the trees --- so see this as an opportunity to improve your work, and not as an exam to be terrified of.

...but, it's still an examination process. ;)
