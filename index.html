    <p>This is a colleciton of observations and pieces of advice around doing a PhD, written by current CS PhD students at Glasgow university and curated via a <a href="https://github.com/Unofficial-Glasgow-PhD/unofficial-advice">Github repo</a>. Thanks for visiting! We hope there's something useful for you here.</p>

    <p>Here's some pages on this project itself:</p>

    <div class="special pages">
        <ul>
            {% for page in site.pages %}
            {% if page.title and page.special_page %} {% unless page.no_index_link %}
            <li>
                <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.url }}">
                    {{ page.title }}
                </a>
            </li>
            {% endunless %}{% endif %}
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>Here's a list of the different pages of advice we've curated so far:</p>

    <div class="page-listing">
        <ul>

                <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.url }}">
                    {{ page.title }}
                </a>
            </li>
            {% endunless %}{% endif %}
